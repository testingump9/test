# **App Name**: PhotoPoet

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Upload an image using a file upload button.

- Primary color: Neutral white or light gray for the background to emphasize the image and text.
- Secondary color: Dark gray or black for text to ensure readability.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements like buttons and links.
- Clean and minimal layout with the image on one side and the poem on the other.
- Subtle fade-in animation when the poem is generated to create a smooth user experience.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for actions like 'upload' and 'save'.
